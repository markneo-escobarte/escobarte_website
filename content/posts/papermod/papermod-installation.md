## Pagani Huayra Roadster BC 

### History

The Pagani Huayra R was unveiled in 2021 as a limited-production hypercar, following in the footsteps of Pagani's earlier track-focused model, the Zonda R. The "R" in its name signifies its track-oriented nature, emphasizing raw power, aerodynamics, and exclusivity.

The "BC" designation stands for Benny Caiola, a close friend of Horacio Pagani and one of the company’s earliest supporters. Benny Caiola was a passionate car collector and an admirer of Pagani's work. In his honor, the "BC" moniker is used for Pagani’s most extreme versions of its hypercars.

### Design Philosophy

The Huayra R BC combines art and performance, following Horacio Pagani's philosophy of blending beauty with cutting-edge technology. The car's development focused on achieving a perfect balance of:

Lightweight construction: Extensive use of Carbo-Titanium and Carbo-Triax materials.
Aerodynamic efficiency: Advanced design to enhance downforce and stability at high speeds.
Track dominance: Engineered purely for the racetrack, it lacks road homologation to maximize performance without compromise.
